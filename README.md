**Avoid Evil Step-Mother Game**

**Description:**
This is a simple text-based adventure game written in Python. The player explores different rooms in a house, collects items, and tries to avoid running into the Evil Step Mom. The goal is to gather all the items scattered around the house before encountering her.

**How to Play:**
  Run the Python file in your terminal or IDE.
  You’ll start in the kitchen.
  Each room may contain an item. You’ll be asked if you want to pick it up.
  Move between rooms by typing directions: north, south, east, or west.
  To exit the game anytime, type quit.
  Check your inventory to see what you’ve collected — it’s displayed automatically after each move.

**Objective:**
Collect all the following items before you encounter the Evil Step Mom:
  Flashlight
  Cell Phone
  House Key
  Remote
  Diary
  Snack
  Photos
Once you have all seven items, you’ll win the game!

**Game Over Conditions:**
  If you enter the bathroom, you’ll meet the Evil Step Mom and lose the game.
  If you collect all seven items before that happens, you’ll win!

**Tips:**
  Explore carefully — some paths may lead you closer to danger.
  Try to map out the rooms as you go to avoid the Evil Step Mom’s location.
  Enjoy the adventure and good luck escaping!
